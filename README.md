# DataProject
By Daniel Zhao
# Purpose
The purpose of this project/application is to create an easier way for users to submit forms to the government. When entering in a form, the user has two choices: the first choice is to fill in the form on the browser and the second choice is to convert the table into an excel sheet and fill it in later. Both the table in the browser and the excel sheet can be read and have their information sent to a database.

## Language
The logic of this application is mainly done in Javascript and Java might be implemented later on. Tools used:
- Server-side logic: *Node.JS*
- Framework: *ExpressJS*
- User authentication: *NONE YET*
= Front-end templating engine: *Mustache*
- Front-end CSS: *Bootstrap*
